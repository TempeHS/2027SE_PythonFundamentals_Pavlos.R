# Prints a column of bricks
#
# EXPLANATION:
# This program prints a simple vertical column of bricks (like in Super Mario!).
#
# KEY CONCEPTS:
# - Each print() outputs one character and moves to a new line
# - Three prints create a column of three bricks
# - This is the simple but repetitive approach
#
# OUTPUT:
# #
# #
# #
#
# THE PROBLEM:
# What if we wanted 100 bricks? We'd need 100 lines of code!
# This doesn't scale. See mario1.py for a loop-based solution.
#
# THE MARIO CONNECTION:
# In the Super Mario games, brick blocks are represented by # characters
# in text-based representations. This is a classic CS50 example!
